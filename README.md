# Data Preparation for Speech-to-Text (ASR) Model Training

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and scripts to **prepare structured datasets** for training **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR)** models.  
It is designed to handle **data collection, cleaning, and formatting** from multiple speech datasets, enabling seamless training for multilingual ASR systems.

## 🎯 Purpose
The files in this repository automate the process of downloading, preprocessing, and structuring audio-transcription datasets from various open-source repositories and corpora, making them ready for ASR model training.

## 📂 Supported Data Sources
The notebooks support extracting and preparing datasets from:
- **Hugging Face** (e.g., AI4Bharat datasets)
- **Indic TTS**
- **OpenSLR**
- **Common Voice (CV_Corpus)**
- And other similar datasets

## 🌐 Supported Languages
Currently, the scripts support **10 Indian languages**:
- Telugu
- Tamil
- Bengali
- Kannada
- Urdu
- Odia
- Punjabi
- Gujarati
- Malayalam
- Marathi

## ⚙️ Features
- 📥 **Dataset download automation** from multiple sources
- 🧹 **Data cleaning** (removing noise, invalid entries, etc.)
- 🗂 **Data structuring** into a uniform format
- 📊 **Statistics generation** for dataset health monitoring
